# Positional-Encoding
Designed a Model using Learnable Positional Encoding Method using Pytorch

This repository demonstrates how to implement a learnable positional encoding method using PyTorch. The code provides a simple example of integrating this encoding into a neural network model, trained on a dummy dataset.

## Introduction
Positional encoding is a technique commonly used in transformer models to give the model information about the order of the input sequence. In this example, we create a learnable positional encoding layer in PyTorch, allowing the model to learn the best positional encodings during training. This is integrated into a simple feedforward neural network and trained on a dummy dataset.

## Features
Learnable positional encoding layer.
Simple feedforward neural network model.
Training loop with basic loss tracking.

## Implementation

### 1. Dummy Dataset
The dummy dataset is used to simulate input sequences that a model might encounter in real-world tasks like natural language processing, time series analysis, or any sequence-related tasks. This dataset contains randomly generated data, serving as a placeholder for actual data.

Sequence Length (seq_length): Represents the number of time steps or tokens in each sequence. For example, in NLP, it could be the number of words in a sentence.

Feature Dimension (feature_dim): Denotes the number of features or dimensions at each time step. In NLP, this could correspond to the dimensionality of word embeddings.

Batch Size (batch_size): Defines the number of sequences processed together in one forward pass of the model. Training with batches helps in efficiently utilizing computational resources.
### 2. Learnable Positional Encoding
Positional encoding is a crucial component in sequence models, particularly in architectures like Transformers, where the model needs to understand the order of elements in a sequence. Traditional positional encoding methods use fixed functions to encode positions, but here we introduce a learnable positional encoding method.

Learnable Positional Encoding: Instead of using fixed positional encodings, we allow the model to learn the best positional encodings during training. This makes the encoding adaptable to the specific characteristics of the data.

Positional Encoding as a Learnable Parameter: In this implementation, the positional encoding is represented as a PyTorch nn.Parameter, which means it is a tensor that will be optimized (learned) during the training process.

Forward Pass: During the forward pass, the positional encodings are added to the input sequence. The operation x + self.positional_encoding ensures that each position in the sequence has a unique encoding that the model learns over time.
### 3. Simple Model
The simple model demonstrates how to integrate the learnable positional encoding into a neural network. The model is basic, focusing on the concept rather than solving a complex problem.

Model Architecture: The model consists of the learnable positional encoding layer followed by a fully connected (linear) layer. The linear layer is responsible for mapping the encoded features to the desired output size.

Fully Connected Layer (self.fc): This layer transforms the features from the positional encoding to the output space. In this case, it reduces the feature dimension to a single output value per time step, which could represent a prediction in a time series or a word in NLP.
### 4. Training the Model
Training the model on the dummy dataset is essential to demonstrate how the learnable positional encodings are optimized. This section covers the training loop, where the model learns to minimize the loss function by adjusting its parameters, including the positional encodings.

Loss Function (nn.MSELoss): Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function, commonly applied in regression tasks. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

Optimizer (optim.Adam): The Adam optimizer is chosen for its efficiency and ability to handle sparse gradients. It adjusts the model's parameters, including the positional encodings, to minimize the loss.

Epochs: The training process runs for a specified number of epochs. An epoch represents one full pass through the entire training dataset. During each epoch, the model sees all the data and updates its parameters accordingly.

Training Loop: In each iteration (epoch), the model's predictions are computed, the loss is calculated, and the gradients are backpropagated to update the model's parameters.

## Training Details

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the difference between predictions and target values.

Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for updating the model's weights during training.

Epochs: The model is trained over 10 epochs to demonstrate how the positional encodings are learned over time.

## Conclusion
This implementation is demonstrated on a simple model with a dummy dataset, the concept is powerful and can be extended to more complex architectures, such as Transformers, which require a deep understanding of the positional relationships within sequential data. The learnable positional encoding method allows the model to adapt the positional information to the specific characteristics of the data, potentially leading to improved performance in various sequence modeling tasks.
